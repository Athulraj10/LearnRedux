Redux
    redux is a global storeage that used to access in every components without props drilling 
    Using this redux we can easily access to any components by wraping the state into main file 'app.js'
    This is the flow of Redux =>>>>>

    As we all doing in previous in React we are create a "state" and update using "setstate"
    In redux We are creating the same things with the help of
    
STEP 1 : 'Store'
STEP 2 : 'Action' => (For example Onclick or Onchange) in that click reducer will be cheak what steps in the button click and after that give control to Reducer
STEP 3 : 'Reducer' => (Based on the 'Action' It will Update the state  )
STEP 4 : 'Provider' => this is the final process The changes Updated by Reducer then we need to update in the react
That process will handles by Provider.It will inject to react using Provider
